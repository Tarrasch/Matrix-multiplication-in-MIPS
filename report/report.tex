\section{Cmoputer System}
We have written a gauss elimination program for MIPS assembler. Details below.
\subsection{hardware}
The MIPS processor have 5 pipe lines stages, seperate I and D cache, a write buffer and two coprocessors.
The caches can be in sizes of 128, 256 and 512 bytes, and are using LRU replacement policy and Write Back replacement policy.
The Least Recently Used is a replacement policy, where the element in the set that was least recently used is replaced, if the cache is full. Note that this only maters in N-way caches (where N>1).
The Write Back writing policy means that when writing to the memory, we don't actually write to the memory if the memory is cached.
